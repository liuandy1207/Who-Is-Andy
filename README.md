- Controls for camera movement.
  - Click an object will zoom the camera onto it at an angle, and there will be limited orbit controls. 
- Prompt the game. How do I get people interested?
- MAYBE A PROGRESS BAR!!! with secrets
- After a few seconds, maybe a jump to projects page?
- Glitter effect on things that havent been clicked. Big finger poitner for clickables.
- Enter the Room or Straight to Portfolio Site
- Find one thing, and then unlock the header?

# Header

- Not sure if I should make it focus in on the object of interest, or maybe just have another page open.
- Maybe a side menu?
